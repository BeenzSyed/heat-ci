THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRICATED!!!
================================
We are in the process of moving this repository and its contents to https://github.com/rackspace-orchestration-templates/sample-templates. This repository will remain for a week or so, but please pull request new example templates and bug-fixes to the new repositories and not this one.

Internal Rackspace users will have a new repository for templates used in internal CI/CD jobs.

Heat Example Templates
======================

This is an internal repository for example Heat templates that Rackspace runs against our Heat CI enviornment. There is little to no structure now, but this should change in the future.

Pull Requests
======================
Pull requests are greatly appreciated.  However, please only make PULL requests against the DEV folder. The reason for this is we need to validate templates for our CI environment, and we don't always run all templates gainst every one of our CI enviornments.
